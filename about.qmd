I am a Digital Humanities Trainer and Project Consultant at the University Library at Virginia Tech. I am trained as a historian and received my Ph.D. in European History from UCLA. My historical research focuses on social and familial basis of politics, religion, and early modern capitalism. I have written on sibling relationships and inheritance in mercantile families from Antwerp during the Dutch Revolt.

I am interested in making the tools of Data Science and Digital Humanities more widely accessible to help build open and reproducible research across the Humanities. I am particularly invested in the use of R, but I also dabble with Python and have interest in continuing to expand my digital skills. I am a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) instructor and maintainer of the [R for Social Scientists lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/).
