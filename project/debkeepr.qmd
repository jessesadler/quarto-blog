`debkeepr` integrates non-decimal currencies that use tripartite and tetrapartite systems into the methodologies of Digital Humanities and the practices of reproducible research. The package makes it possible for historical non-decimal currencies, such as the tripartite system of pounds, shillings, and pence, to behave like decimalized numeric values through the implementation of the `deb_lsd`, `deb_tetra`, and `deb_decimal` vector types. These types are based on the infrastructure provided by the [vctrs package](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/). `debkkeepr` simplifies the process of performing arithmetic calculations with non-decimal currencies — such as adding £3 13s. 4d. sterling to £8 15s. 9d. sterling — and also provides a basis for analyzing account books with thousands of transactions recorded in non-decimal currencies. The name of the `debkeepr` package derives from this latter capability of analyzing historical account books that often used [double-entry bookkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system).

## Installation
You can install `debkeepr` from GitHub with [remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org):

```{r remotes, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jessesadler/debkeepr")
```

## Historical Background
The `debkeepr` package uses the nomenclature of [l, s, and d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd) to represent pounds, shillings, and pence units in non-decimal currencies. The abbreviations derive from the Latin terms [*libra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_livre), [*solidus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_(coin)), and [*denarius*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius). The *libra* was a Roman measurement of weight, while the *solidus* and *denarius* were both Roman coins. The *denarius* was a silver coin from the era of the Republic, in contrast to the golden *solidus* that was issued in the Late Empire. As the production of silver coins overtook that of gold by the 8th century, a *solidus* came to represent 12 silver *denarii* coins, and 240 *denarii* were — for a time — made from one *libra* or pound of silver. The custom of counting coins in dozens (*solidi*) and scores of dozens (*librae*) spread throughout the Carolingian Empire and became ingrained in much of Europe. However, a variety of currencies or monies of account used [other bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-decimal_currency) for the *solidus* and *denarius* units. Some currencies and other value systems, such as those for weights, added a fourth unit. `debkeepr` provides a consistent manner for dealing with any set of bases within tripartite or tetrapartite systems through the `bases` attribute of `deb_lsd`, `deb_tetra`, and `deb_decimal` vectors.
