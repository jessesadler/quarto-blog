Version 0.1.1 is debkeepr's first release on CRAN.\"\ncategories: \n  - rstats\n  - debkeepr\n---\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![](img/logo.png)\n:::\n\n`debkeepr` is now---finally---on CRAN with [version 0.1.1](https://cran.r-project.org/package=debkeepr)! `debkeepr` integrates non-decimal currencies that use tripartite or tetrapartite systems into the methodologies of Digital Humanities and the practices of reproducible research. The package makes it possible for historical non-decimal currencies, such as the tripartite system of pounds, shillings, and pence (£465 12s. 8d.), to behave like decimalized values through the implementation of the `deb_lsd`, `deb_tetra`, and `deb_decimal` vector types. These types are based on the infrastructure provided by the [vctrs package](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/). The name of the package derives from its ability to analyze historical account books that used the system of **D**ouble-**e**ntry **b**ook**keep**ing.\n\nYou can now install the released version of `debkeepr` from CRAN or the development version on GitHub:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Install CRAN release\ninstall.packages(\"debkeepr\")\n\n# Install development version\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"jessesadler/debkeepr\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nPlease open an [issue](https://github.com/jessesadler/debkeepr/issues) if you have any questions, comments, or requests.\n\nThis release has been a long time coming. I first started to develop `debkeepr` in 2018 to deal with the problem of performing mathematical operations on non-decimal currencies of pounds, shillings, and pence that was crucial to my research on [merchant families in the 16th and 17th centuries](/project/df-inheritance.qmd). I introduced the package with [this blog post](/post/debkeepr-intro/) in September 2018. After talking to Hadley Wickham at the Tidyverse developer day at RStudio::conf 2019, I completely rewrote the package, using the [vctrs package](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/) to develop fully integrated S3 vector types that could represent non-decimal currencies. I discussed this process at [RStudio::conf 2020](https://posit.co/resources/videos/vctrs-creating-custom-vector-classes-with-the-vctrs-package/). Since then, I have been developing the package on and off, while also using it for my historical research.[^1] But I never quite got around to putting the package on CRAN. However, progress was made. I kept up with changes to `vctrs` and [dplyr](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/06/dplyr-1-0-0/) and added a new class for tetrapartite values: pounds, shillings, pence, and farthings. The forthcoming second edition of the [*R Packages*](https://r-pkgs.org) book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan and the recently updated chapter on [Releasing to CRAN](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html) helped motivate me to finally prep and submit the package for CRAN release. On 22 March 2023 version 0.1.1 of `debkeepr` was accepted on CRAN after one quite minor round of changes.\n\n## Usage\nThe `debkeepr` package introduces three new vector types---`deb_lsd()`, `deb_tetra()`, and `deb_decimal()`---to deal with two interrelated problems inherent in historical non-decimal currencies and other such value systems.\n\n1. Historical currencies consist of three or four separate non-decimal **units**.\n2. The **bases** of the shillings, pence, and optionally farthing units differed by region, coinage, and era.\n\nThe `deb_lsd` type maintains the tripartite structure of non-decimal currencies and provides a `bases` attribute to record the bases for the shillings and pence units. The `deb_tetra` type extends the concept of the `deb_lsd` type to incorporate currencies and other types of values that consist of four units. The `deb_decimal` type provides a means to decimalize both `deb_lsd` and `deb_tetra` types, while keeping track of the two or three non-decimal `bases` and the `unit` represented as attributes.[^2] \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(debkeepr)\n\n# Create deb_lsd, deb_tetra, and deb_decimal vectors\n# with default bases of 20s. 12d.\n\n# deb_lsd vector: £8 13s. 4d.\ndeb_lsd(l = 8, s = 13, d = 4)\n#> <deb_lsd[1]>\n#> [1] 8:13s:4d\n#> # Bases: 20s 12d\n\n# deb_tetra vector: £8 13s. 4d. 3f.\ndeb_tetra(l = 8, s = 13, d = 4, f = 3)\n#> <deb_tetra[1]>\n#> [1] 8:13s:4d:3f\n#> # Bases: 20s 12d 4f\n\n# deb_decimal: £8 13s. 4d. in decimalized shillings\ndeb_decimal(173.33, unit = \"s\")\n#> <deb_decimal[1]>\n#> [1] 173.33\n#> # Unit: solidus\n#> # Bases: 20s 12d\n\n# Cast £8 13s. 4d. to a decimal form\ndeb_as_decimal(deb_lsd(8, 13, 4))\n#> <deb_decimal[1]>\n#> [1] 8.666667\n#> # Unit: libra\n#> # Bases: 20s 12d\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Resources\n`debkeepr` provides three vignettes and example data to help get started using the package.\n\n- [Getting Started with debkeepr vignette](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/articles/debkeepr.html) provides a thorough introduction to the package and the three `debkeepr` vector types.\n- [Transactions in Richard Dafforne's Journal vignette](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/articles/transactions.html) goes through examples of financial and arithmetic calculations dealing with various currencies taken from the practice journal in Richard Dafforne's *Merchant's Mirrour* (1660), a 17th-century textbook for learning accounting practices.\n- [Analysis of Richard Dafforne's Journal and Ledger vignette](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/articles/ledger.html) analyzes and visualizes the practice double-entry bookkeeping ledger from Dafforne's *Merchant's Mirrour* as found in the [`dafforne_transactions`](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/reference/dafforne_transactions.html) and [`dafforne_accounts`](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/reference/dafforne_accounts.html) data provided in `debkeepr`.\n\nThe rest of this post will provide a quick overview of how `debkeepr` can assist historians in research involving non-decimal currencies and bring the study of historical account books into the practices of reproducible research.\n\n## Arithmetic with non-decimal currencies\n\nArithmetic with non-decimal currencies is cumbersome and error-prone, at least if you were not educated within non-decimal systems. The primary issue is the need to do [compound unit arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic#Compound_unit_arithmetic) to normalize units according to their bases.\n\n::: {layout=\"[60,40]\"}\n![A scratchpad from the archive of Daniel van der Meulen](img/barbary-scratchpad.jpg){#fig-barbary}\n\n![Compound unit arithmetic](img/compound-arithmetic.png){#fig-cua}\n:::\n\n`debkeepr` types provide a way to access arithmetic operations and [mathematical functions](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/reference/mathematics.html) for non-decimal values, drastically simplifying these calculations. For instance, we can add together the values in @fig-cua with either `+` or `sum()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Add multiple deb_lsd vectors\ndeb_lsd(28, 15, 8) + deb_lsd(32, 8, 11) + deb_lsd(54, 18, 7) + deb_lsd(18, 12, 9)\n#> <deb_lsd[1]>\n#> [1] 134:15s:11d\n#> # Bases: 20s 12d\n\n# Sum of one deb_lsd vector\nsum(\n  deb_lsd(l = c(28, 32, 54, 18),\n          s = c(15, 8, 18, 12),\n          d = c(8, 11, 7, 9))\n)\n#> <deb_lsd[1]>\n#> [1] 134:15s:11d\n#> # Bases: 20s 12d\n```\n:::\n\n\nAddition and subtraction might be cumbersome with non-decimal values, but multiplication and division get tricky quite quickly. We can see this using examples from the article on Arithmetic in the third edition of the [*Encyclopedia Britannica*, printed in 1797](http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/metabook?id=britannica3) and comparing these to the process with `debkeepr` types.\n\nThe *Encyclopedia Britannica* outlines the process for multiplying £15 3s. 8d. sterling by 32 and £17 3s. 8d. sterling by 75. It breaks down larger multiplication operations into smaller ones. Multiplying £15 3s. 8d. sterling by 32 becomes a matter of sequentially multiplying the monetary value by 8 and then by 4. Multiplying £17 3s. 8d. sterling by 75 is presented as a three step process of multiplying by 3, then by 5, and then 5 again as `3 * 5 * 5 = 75`. With `debkeepr` you can use multiplication as you would any other numeric vector.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Multiply £15 3s. 8d. sterling by 32\ndeb_lsd(15, 3, 8) * 32\n#> <deb_lsd[1]>\n#> [1] 485:17s:4d\n#> # Bases: 20s 12d\n\n# Multiply £17 3s. 8d. sterling by 75\ndeb_lsd(17, 3, 8) * 75\n#> <deb_lsd[1]>\n#> [1] 1288:15s:0d\n#> # Bases: 20s 12d\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![Multiplication in *Encyclopedia Britannica*](img/lsd-multiplication.png){#fig-multiplication height=\"350\"}\n:::\n\nThe process for division presented in the *Encyclopedia Britannica* might bring you back to grade school and long division problems, though the operation also includes multiplication due to the need to convert between units. The *Encyclopedia* shows the division of £465 12s. 8d. sterling by 72 and 345 hundredweight 1 quarter 8 lbs by 22. This latter example provides an opportunity to demonstrate how you can use the `bases` argument in `debkeepr`-type vectors to adapt them to other value systems besides the default of 20 shillings to the pound and 12 pence to the shilling. In this case, there are 4 quarters in a hundredweight and 28 pounds in a quarter. This example also gives proof of the gains in accuracy, as the answer is shown as 15 cwt. 2 q. 21 lb., but it should actually be 22 lb.[^3] Note too that the output of `debkeepr` types shows the bases of the vectors: `# Bases: 4s 28d`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Divide £465 12s. 8d. sterling by 72\ndeb_lsd(465, 12, 8) / 72\n#> <deb_lsd[1]>\n#> [1] 6:9s:4.111d\n#> # Bases: 20s 12d\n\n# Divide 345 hundredweight 1 quarter 8 lbs by 22\ndeb_lsd(345, 1, 8, bases = c(4, 28)) / 22\n#> <deb_lsd[1]>\n#> [1] 15:2s:22d\n#> # Bases: 4s 28d\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![Division in *Encyclopedia Britannica*](img/lsd-division.png){#fig-division height=\"400px\"}\n:::\n\nThe example of dividing a measurement of weight also provides an opportunity to use the `deb_tetra` type that allows for four units, here hundredweight, quarters, stones, and pounds. We can, thus, rewrite the value to be divided as 345 cwt. 1 q. 0 st. 8 lb.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Divide 345 cwt. 1 q. 0 st. 8 lb. by 22\ndeb_tetra(345, 1, 0, 8, bases = c(4, 2, 14)) / 22\n#> <deb_tetra[1]>\n#> [1] 15:2s:1d:8f\n#> # Bases: 4s 2d 14f\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor many more examples, including how to work with vectors of different types and different bases see the [Getting Started with debkeepr vignette](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/articles/debkeepr.html) and the [Transactions in Richard Dafforne's Journal vignette](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/articles/transactions.html).\n\n## `debkeepr` and double-entry bookkeeping\n\n![Account book of Jacques della Faille, 1585](img/account-book.jpg){#fig-accounts}\n\nThe ability to treat non-decimal values of three (`deb_lsd`) or four (`deb_tetra`) units as numeric vectors greatly simplifies analysis of these types of values. However, it is the integration of `debkeepr` types in data frame columns---particularly in the form of what `debkeepr` refers to as [transaction data frames](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/reference/transactions.html#transactions-data-frames-)---that makes it possible to bring the analysis of historical account books recorded in various non-decimal currencies into the practices of Digital Humanities and reproducible research. `debkeepr` provides a methodology to enter data from historical account books and create `deb_lsd` or `deb_tetra` columns with `deb_gather_lsd()` and `deb_gather_tetra()` respectively. These data frames can then be analyzed and visualized using methods such as those provided by the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), particularly with [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(240)\n# Raw data of a transaction data frame\n# Input each unit of non-decimal currency as separate column\nraw_data <- data.frame(\n  id = 1:5,\n  credit = c(1, 3, 2, 2, 3),\n  debit  = c(3, 2, 1, 3, 1),\n  l = sample(20:100, 5),\n  s = sample(1:19, 5),\n  d = sample(1:11, 5)\n)\nraw_data\n#>   id credit debit  l  s  d\n#> 1  1      1     3 24  6 10\n#> 2  2      3     2 34 12  5\n#> 3  3      2     1 83  2  4\n#> 4  4      2     3 41  5  9\n#> 5  5      3     1 92 11 11\n\n# Create deb_lsd column\ndeb_gather_lsd(raw_data,\n               l = l, s = s, d = d,\n               lsd_col = lsd, replace = TRUE)\n#>   id credit debit        lsd\n#> 1  1      1     3  24:6s:10d\n#> 2  2      3     2  34:12s:5d\n#> 3  3      2     1   83:2s:4d\n#> 4  4      2     3   41:5s:9d\n#> 5  5      3     1 92:11s:11d\n```\n:::\n\n\n`debkeepr` includes two data frames of example data. `dafforne_transactions` is a transactions data frame that has columns for transaction `id`, `credit` account, `debit` account, `date` of the transaction, and the value of the transaction as a `deb_lsd` column with bases 20s. and 12d., along with some addition information. This is paired with a data frame containing information about the 46 accounts in Dafforne's practice ledger. See `?dafforne_transactions` and `?dafforne_accounts` for more details. For a fuller discussion of using these data frames, see the [Analysis of Richard Dafforne’s Journal and Ledger vignette](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/articles/ledger.html).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load tidyverse packages\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Transactions data frame\ndafforne_transactions\n#> # A tibble: 177 × 8\n#>       id credit debit date                  lsd journal ledger description      \n#>    <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <date>     <lsd[20s:12d]>   <dbl> <chr>  <chr>            \n#>  1     1      2     1 1633-01-01    1000:15s:7d       1 1/1    Various coins of…\n#>  2     2      2     3 1633-01-01     477:10s:0d       1 1/1    60 Leeds dozens …\n#>  3     3      2     4 1633-01-01       55:0s:6d       1 2/1    5 barrels that r…\n#>  4     4      2     5 1633-01-01      240:0s:0d       1 2/1    For 800 French c…\n#>  5     5      2     6 1633-01-01      229:0s:0d       1 2/1    2290 guilders re…\n#>  6     6      2     8 1633-01-01       3:17s:8d       1 3/1    Expenses for the…\n#>  7     7      7     2 1633-01-01      150:0s:0d       1 1/2    Ready money from…\n#>  8     8      9    11 1633-01-04      360:0s:0d       1 4/3    100 Leeds dozens…\n#>  9     9      1     9 1633-01-04      144:0s:0d       2 3/1    For 2/5 of the 1…\n#> 10    10      5    10 1633-01-04      120:0s:0d       2 3/2    400 French crown…\n#> # ℹ 167 more rows\n\n# Accounts data frame\ndafforne_accounts\n#> # A tibble: 46 × 5\n#>       id account                                    ledger investor  description\n#>    <int> <chr>                                       <int> <chr>     <chr>      \n#>  1     1 Cash                                            1 Ego       Account fo…\n#>  2     2 Stock                                           1 Ego       Account of…\n#>  3     3 Wares                                           1 Ego       Account fo…\n#>  4     4 Kettles                                         2 Ego       Account fo…\n#>  5     5 Jean du Boys - account current                  2 Jean du … Factor in …\n#>  6     6 Jacob Symonson - account by him in company      2 Jacob Sy… Aggregatio…\n#>  7     7 Jacob Symonson - account current                2 Jacob Sy… Current ac…\n#>  8     8 Jacob Symonson - Cochineal                      3 Jacob Sy… Sale of co…\n#>  9     9 George Pinchback                                3 George P… Account wi…\n#> 10    10 Jacob Symonson - ready money                    3 Jacob Sy… Account of…\n#> # ℹ 36 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\n`debkeepr` provides a [set of functions](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/reference/transactions.html) that work with data frames with the same structure as `dafforne_transactions`. `deb_account_summary()` is useful for obtaining an overview of the account book at its closing, providing a summary of the total credits, debits, and current value of each account.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndafforne_transactions |> \n  deb_account_summary(credit = credit, debit = debit, lsd = lsd)\n#> # A tibble: 46 × 4\n#>    account_id         credit          debit        current\n#>         <dbl> <lsd[20s:12d]> <lsd[20s:12d]> <lsd[20s:12d]>\n#>  1          1   1956:10s:11d    2903:13s:0d   -947:-2s:-1d\n#>  2          2     2006:3s:9d      150:0s:0d     1856:3s:9d\n#>  3          3      570:0s:0d      570:0s:0d        0:0s:0d\n#>  4          4       75:0s:8d       75:0s:8d        0:0s:0d\n#>  5          5      813:3s:0d      813:3s:0d        0:0s:0d\n#>  6          6     568:1s:11d      869:2s:7d    -301:0s:-8d\n#>  7          7   2958:18s:10d   2958:18s:10d        0:0s:0d\n#>  8          8    1580:10s:0d    1580:10s:0d        0:0s:0d\n#>  9          9     1744:1s:4d     1744:1s:4d        0:0s:0d\n#> 10         10      606:2s:6d      606:2s:6d        0:0s:0d\n#> # ℹ 36 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can present this information in a line-range plot in which the upper range represents the total credit, the lower range the total debit, and a point for the current value. This also allows an opportunity to point out some limitations of the `deb_lsd` and `deb_tetra` vector types; `ggplot2` currently does not know how to pick a scale for `deb_lsd` and `deb_tetra` columns. However, `deb_decimal` columns work as expected. It is therefore necessary to cast the `deb_lsd` or `deb_tetra` columns to `deb_decimal` with `deb_as_decimal()`, either before or within the `ggplot()` call.[^4] For a line-range plot we also need to turn the `debit` column into negative values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot summary of accounts\ndafforne_transactions |> \n  mutate(lsd = deb_as_decimal(lsd)) |> \n  deb_account_summary() |> # Columns have default names of credit, debit, and lsd\n  mutate(debit = -debit) |>\n  ggplot() + \n    geom_linerange(aes(x = account_id, ymin = debit, ymax = credit)) + \n    geom_point(aes(x = account_id, y = current,\n\t                 color = if_else(current == 0, \"Closed\", \"Open\"))) +\n    scale_color_manual(values = c(Open = \"black\", Closed = \"blue\")) + \n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar(prefix = \"\\u00a3\")) + \n    labs(x = \"Accounts\",\n         y = \"Pounds sterling\",\n         color = \"Status\",\n         title = \"Summary of the accounts\") + \n    theme_light()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/summary-plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## `debkeepr` and reproducibility\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![Scratchpad: Doing math by hand](img/math-scratchpad.jpg){#fig-scratchpad height=\"400px\"}\n:::\n\nThe above plot only scratches the surface of the possibilities for exploring and analyzing account books that use historical non-decimal currencies with `debkeepr`. The [Transactions in Richard Dafforne's Journal vignette](https://jessesadler.github.io/debkeepr/articles/transactions.html) provides additional examples. Yet, what I think is the most significant about `debkeepr` is not any one plot, time saving feature, or type of analysis, but rather the possibility of using the practices of reproducible research in the context of historical economic data. Individual calculations are easier to track and validate when written in code rather than scrawled out on a scratch piece of paper or entered into a calculator. Even more importantly, `debkeepr` provides a workflow for entering data from account books into a data base, [tidying the data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html), and then exploring, analyzing, and visualizing the data in ways that integrate with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) and more general practices of data analysis in R.\n\nI have seen this in my own work on the [accounts of the estate of Jan della Faille de Oude](/project/df-inheritance.qmd). Without `debkeepr` the process of transcribing the over 2,100 transactions and analyzing the 480 accounts appeared to have limited use for quite a bit of work. Instead, I picked a handful of crucial accounts and worked by hand. With `debkeepr` the effort becomes worthwhile and whole plethora of research questions and ways to communicate were opened up. It is my hope that `debkeepr` can help bring to light crucial and interesting social interactions that are buried in economic manuscripts, making these stories accessible to a wider audience.\n\n[^1]: For instance, in my talk, \"Rough Estimation: Inheritance, Accounting, and Sibling Rivalry in an Early Modern Merchant Family.\" See the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHTXnYiNC5c) and/or [slides](https://www.jessesadler.com/slides/lchs2021.pdf).\n\n[^2]: `debkeepr` uses the nomenclature of [l, s, and d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd) to represent pounds, shillings, and pence units in non-decimal currencies. The abbreviations derive from the Latin terms [*libra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_livre), [*solidus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_(coin)), and [*denarius*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius). It uses the default of 20 shillings to the pound and 12 pence to the shilling that became ingrained in much of Europe during the [Carolingian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Empire) in the 9th century. However, a variety of [other bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-decimal_currency) also developed over time, and so these bases can be modified by the user using the `bases` argument.\n\n[^3]: Checking the long division at the bottom of the calculation, 22 goes into 44 twice not once.\n\n[^4]: The only context in which casting to `deb_decimal` results in any loss of information is in labeling the plotted values. However, this can be rectified through `deb_text()`, which provides a flexible way to format `debkeepr` types as text.\n",
