title: About me
---

I am an early modern historian interested in the social and familial basis of politics, religion, and early modern capitalism. I received a Ph.D. in European History from UCLA in 2015 and have taught courses on cultural and intellectual history of early modern Europe and the Atlantic. My research increasingly makes use of the tools of Digital Humanities, particularly through the R programming language. I am interested in making the tools of Data Science and Digital Humanities more widely accessible to help build open and reproducible research across a wide array of fields.

### Research

My research investigates the familial basis of the early modern capitalism through archival research on two mercantile families from Antwerp at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century. I am currently working on a manuscript that argues for the significance of sibling relationships and inheritance in the development of early modern trade. My manuscript places concepts such as patriarchy, emotion, exile, and friendship at the heart of the efficacy of long-distance trade networks and the growth of capitalism.
