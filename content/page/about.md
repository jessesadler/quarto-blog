title: About me
---

I'm currently a lecturer at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. I am an early modern historian interested in the social and familial basis of politics, religion, and trade. I received a Ph.D. in European History from UCLA in 2015 and have taught courses on cultural and intellectual history of early modern Europe and the Atlantic.

### Research

My research investigates the familial basis of the early modern capitalism through archival research on two mercantile families from Antwerp at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century. I am currently working on a manuscript that argues for the significance of sibling relationships and inheritance in the development of early modern trade. My manuscript places concepts such as patriarchy, emotion, exile, and friendship at the heart of the efficacy of long-distance trade networks and the growth of capitalism.

My research increasingly makes use of the tools of Digital Humanities, particularly through the R programming language. Visit the [Projects page](https://www.jessesadler.com/project/) to see descriptions of my current digital projects.
